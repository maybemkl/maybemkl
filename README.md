### Hello! 👋

I am a Ph.D. Candidate with the [Platial Analysis](https://platial.science/) and [Urban Politics and Governance](https://upgo.lab.mcgill.ca/) labs at McGill University. My primary interests are two-fold. 1️⃣ I work on the application of statistical methods in general and natural language processing in particular to complex social problems. 2️⃣ I am investigating the epistemological and historical foundations of natural language processing and large-language modeling, from the postwar cybernetics movement to contemporary practices. 

Some of my projects and publications include:

- 🗺️ Private-information retrieval (PIR) tile-serving and NLP for [Drift Maps](https://driftmaps.net/)
- 🏙️ Data-driven analyses on rental market financialization ([JAPA](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01944363.2022.2126382)) and the linguistic markers of gentrification ([EMNLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15302), [GIScience](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2023/18911/pdf/LIPIcs-GIScience-2023-16.pdf))
- 📖 Genealogical and critical work on the epistemological foundations of distributional semantics ([NAACL](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.327/))
