### Hi there 👋

I am a Ph.D. Candidate with the Platial Analysis and Urban Politics and Governance labs at McGill University. My primary interests are two-fold. 1️⃣ I work on the application of statistical methods in general and natural language processing in particular to complex social problems. 2️⃣ I am investigating the epistemological and historical foundations of natural language processing and large-language modeling, from the postwar cybernetics movement to contemporary practices. 

Some of my projects and publications include:

- 🗺️ Private-information retrieval (PIR) tile-serving and NLP for [Drift Maps](https://driftmaps.net/)
- 🏙️ Data-driven analyses on rental market financialization (JAPA) and the linguistic markers of gentrification (EMNLP, GIScience)
- 📖 Genealogical and critical work on the epistemological foundations of distributional semantics ([NAACL](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.327/))
